## graphify

This project has a knowledge graph at graphify-out/ with god nodes, community structure, and cross-file relationships.

When the user types `/graphify`, invoke the `skill` tool with `skill: "graphify"` before doing anything else.

Rules:
- For codebase questions, first run `& (Get-Content graphify-out/.graphify_python) -m graphify query "<question>"` (or `graphify query`) when graphify-out/graph.json exists. Use the same saved interpreter for `path "<A>" "<B>"` and `explain "<concept>"`. These return a scoped subgraph, usually much smaller than GRAPH_REPORT.md or raw grep output.
- Dirty graphify-out/ files are expected after hooks or incremental updates; dirty graph files are not a reason to skip graphify. Only skip graphify if the task is about stale or incorrect graph output, or the user explicitly says not to use it.
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, use it for broad navigation instead of raw source browsing.
- Read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md only for broad architecture review or when query/path/explain do not surface enough context.
- After modifying code, run `& (Get-Content graphify-out/.graphify_python) -m graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost).
